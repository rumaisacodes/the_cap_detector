# 🧢 Cap Detector 2026

Ever wonder if someone is telling the truth or just "capping"? This simple Python script uses "brainwave scanning" (okay, it's just a random choice generator, lol) to give you a final verdict!

## 🚀 How it Works
1. Run the script.
2. Enter a statement you want to check.
3. Wait for the dramatic "Scanning brainwaves..." animation.
4. Get your verdict: **No Cap**, **Big Cap**, **Facts**, or a **Reality Check**.

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- **Python 3.x**: The core language.
- **`random` module**: To pick the verdict by luck.
- **`time` module**: To create that high-tech loading suspense.

## 📚 What I Learned Building This
This was one of my first Python projects! While making it, I learned:
* **User Input**: How to let the computer "listen" to what I type.
* **Lists**: How to store multiple options in one container.
* **f-strings**: How to put my variables directly into sentences easily.
* **Loops/Delays**: How to make the program pause for a better user experience.

## 🕹️ How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed. Then:
1. Download `cap_detector.py`.
2. Open your terminal or VS Code.
3. Run: `python cap_detector.py`
